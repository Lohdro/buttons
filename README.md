# Buttons

> How many ways are there to assemble a button? Apparently too many.

This project is an exercise in separation of concerns related to structure, style and content.

Each example in the project demonstrates a different approach to separating concerns, and in general each example builds on the last to demonstrate a progressively higher level of abstraction.

No judgement is made concerning how much abstraction is good or bad.


## TODO

* versatile button that can be `<a href="#"></a>`, `<button></button>`, `<input type="text">` etc.


## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
Lint and test your code using [grunt][http://gruntjs.com/].
